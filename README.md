# AI-enabled PLeaP - A Personalised Learning Platform

## Description
Personalised education has become a cornerstone of adaptive learning, particularly in the era of online education. This is due to the diverse learning preferences of individuals, where a ‘one-size- fits-all’ approach fails to ensure effective knowledge transmission. This raises the question of how artificial intelligence can generate content to optimise customisation strategies for diverse learners and enhance learning satisfaction.

In this project, we developed a personalised learning platform powered by artificial intelligence to identify the best personalisation strategies for diverse learners. New learning objects are automatically generated based on the content provided by lesson creators. The generation of learning objects is categorised into component-wise content generation, which provides different modalities of the same content, and lesson-wise content generation, utilising key-phrase extraction, prompt engineering, and in adherence to the Bloom’s Taxonomy hierarchy. We modelled learners and learning objects using the Felder-Silverman Learning Styles Model (FSLSM) and explored recommendation algorithms through content-based, collaborative, and hybrid filtering. Learning object recommendations are based on predictions made using k-means clustering of explicit ratings of learning objects provided by users, correlated by Pearson correlation.
