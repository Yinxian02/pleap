Title: Making the Python code run correctly

And we now try to get the Python code to actually run on the computer!

Summary:
We have typed out our Python code into a text editor.
And tried to understand how to approach debugging your code.
You have looked at some common Python errors.
We discussed terminologies like strongly-typed languages and weakly-typed languages.
Now try to implement the guessing game yourself (without looking at my code).
You can just use the widget below for now if you do not yet have Python installed on your computer. Lesson 2 will guide you to installing Python on your computer.
Of course, feel free to run your code on your own computer if you already have Python installed.
